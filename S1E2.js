// its not the react that makes our app fast its some packages along with react that makes our app fast . so now we are going to learn that what it takes to build a production based react code and a react file that other directly teaches
// we use npm because it manages the packages we use 
// to use npm we use command npm init 
// after entering the command it asks some keys and some other jsut enter it and next it creates a json file that contains the details we enterd after entering the command about npm.
// package.json is a configuration of npm and thsi is important to remember that package.json is useful and its just get updated when ever there is mager updation are needed and it gets updated.
// after we install a new bundler like parcel this helps us to pack the code and send it to the production phase
// after the completion of the parcel there creates a new file called package-lock.json this is helpful in keeping the track on exact version of the code.
// there creates a another file called nodemodules this is a huge file.
// these nodemodule it fetches the all the code of all the dependencies into our system.and it contains all the packages we need.
// trasitive dependencies.
// now let us come to a dicussion that should we put node_modules into git ? the answer is not needed we should only push the essential things into the git.
// the things that can be regenerated are no longer needed to push into the git.
// we should push package.json and package-lock.json into the git because they are essential to our project/app.
// to ignite an app we use npx package_name file_name . this helps in launching / executing the app.
// now let us ignite our app. for that we use the above command that helps us to execute the package we want.
// the difference between npm : that installs the package and npx: executes the package.
//to run this react code in previous chrome we use browserlist: this helps us to run our code every where.
